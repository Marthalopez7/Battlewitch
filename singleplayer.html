        <h3>How to play</h3>
        <ol>
            <h4><li>Organize your characters</li></h4>
            <p>Before starting the match, you have to organize where you want your characters to be and in what square(s). The witches and cauldrons may not be touching edges or placed diagonally. Once you are done, press the submit button to start the game.</p>
            <h4><li>Call your shot</li></h4>
            <p>When it is your turn on the board, pick a square where you think you might uncover a witch. Then press the submit button to confirm your selection. </p>
            <h4><li>It's a hit!</li></h4>
            <p>After confirming your selection, if you do manage to uncover a part of a witch or a cauldron after throwing a potion, you get another chance to uncover more of the witch. This keeps going until you miss a shot. You may also have the chance to uncover a new type of potion that will take effect immediately. The different types of potions are: <ol>
                <li>Shield potion, when your opponent takes a shot, whether is a hit or miss, you will not take any damage</li>
                <li>Healing potion, you are able to heal one of your characters (whether it has already fallen or just took some damage)</li>
                <li>Movement potion, you are able to move one of your characters</li>
                <li>Clairvoyance potion, you are able to see one row or column of your opponent’s board.</li>
                <li>Explosion potion, you may click a square and a t-shaped explosion will occur, revealing your opponent's characters</li>
                <li>Skip potion, this potion skips your turn</li>
            </ol></p>
            <h4><li>It’s a miss!</li></h4>
            <p>After confirming your selection, if the space you chose does not uncover a part of a witch or a cauldron, your turn ends.  Continue switching off until the one player's witches and cauldrons are uncovered first.
            </p>
            <h4><li>Defence</li></h4>
            <p>After your turn ends, it is now your opponent's turn to try and find your characters. If your opponent hits one of your cauldrons, then you have been cursed and your screen becomes foggy and unclear. Forcing you to take a shot blindly. 
            </p>
            <h4><li>You win!</li></h4>
            <p>If you manage to uncover all your opponents witches and cauldrons first, you win the game. You will see a screen indicating that you have won and that the game is over. You may also press the button for a special surprise.
            </p>
            <h4><li>You lose</li></h4>
            <p>If your opponent uncovers all your witches and cauldrons first, you lose the game. You will see a screen indicating that you have lost and that the game is over. However, you may press the button for a “nice” message. ;)
