            <h3>How to play</h3>
            <ol>
                <h4><li>Setup</li></h4>
                <p>Before starting the match, setup where you want your characters to be. The witches and cauldrons may not be touching edges or placed diagonally. Once you are done, press the submit button to start the game.</p>
                <h4><li>Call your shot</li></h4>
                <p>Pick a square to possibly uncover a witch or cauldron. Then press the submit button to confirm your selection. </p>
                <h4><li>It's a hit!</li></h4>
                <p>After confirming your selection, if you manage to uncover a part of a witch or a cauldron, your turn continues. This keeps going until you miss a shot. You may also have the chance to uncover a new type of potion that will take effect immediately. The different types of potions are: <ol>
                    <li>Shield potion: You will not take any damage for one turn</li>
                    <li>Healing potion: Heal one of your characters (whether it has already fallen or took some damage)</li>
                    <li>Clairvoyance potion: Expose one row or column of your opponent’s board</li>
                    <li>Explosion potion: Your next shot will be a cross-shaped explosion</li>
                    <li>Skip potion: Skips your turn</li>
                </ol></p>
                <h4><li>It’s a miss!</li></h4>
                <p>After confirming your selection, if the space you chose does not uncover a part of a witch or a cauldron, your turn ends. Continue switching off until one player's witches or cauldrons are uncovered first.
                </p>
                </p>
                <h4><li>You win!</li></h4>
                <p>If you manage to uncover all your opponents witches and cauldrons first, you win the game. You will see a pop-up with a special surprise.
                </p>
                <h4><li>You lose</li></h4>
                <p>If your opponent uncovers all your witches and cauldrons first, you lose the game. You will see a pop-up with a “nice” message. ;)
